What is External Secrets Operator (ESO)?

External Secrets Operator (ESO) is a Kubernetes operator designed to enhance the secure and scalable management of secrets. Its primary function involves synchronizing secrets from external secret management systems, which can include popular platforms like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and Google Secret Manager, into Kubernetes secrets. This integration enables the secure storage of sensitive information within a centralized repository, offering controlled and secure access for your applications.

Architecture:
The architecture of the External Secrets Operator enhances Kubernetes functionality through the introduction of Custom Resources. These Custom Resources play a pivotal role in specifying the location and synchronization methods for secrets. The operator operates via a controller that interfaces with an external API to fetch secrets, and it subsequently generates Kubernetes secrets based on this external data. Importantly, the controller continually monitors the external API for changes in secrets, ensuring that the Kubernetes cluster's secrets stay synchronized and up-to-date through automatic reconciliation.

Core Resources:
The core resources of the External Secrets Operator typically include the following:
Provider: In External Secrets Operator (ESO), a "Provider" is a Kubernetes custom resource that outlines the configuration for ESO's interactions with an external secret management system.
SecretStore: Provider-specific configurations are established through SecretStore, which operates within a specific namespace. Each SecretStore is dedicated to a singular instance of an external API.
ClusterSecretStore: The ClusterSecretStore is a SecretStore scoped to the entire cluster, accessible by all ExternalSecrets across namespaces. It serves as a centralized access point to your secret backend.
ExternalSecret: An ExternalSecret defines which data to retrieve, specifies the transformation process, and outlines how it should be saved as a Kubernetes Secret with the Kind attribute.
