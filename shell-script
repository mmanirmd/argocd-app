I have been with TDA Ameritrade/Scwhwab for over 15 years, initially joining the Software Configuration Management team where I supported version control tools such as ClearCase and Subversion, alongside Build/Release engineering. In recent years, I transitioned to working with Containerized and Cloud technologies like PCF and Kubernetes, GCP, AWS, and presently I am working building on-prem platform using Anthos GKE. Outside of work, I enjoy learning about new cloud technologies, spending time learning options trading, following cricket matches, enjoying movies, and experimenting with various recipes.
